In the first program, The program is fast but the sum is incorrect in most cases since there is a missed summation in the code when another thread gets locked out of the shared variable.

In the second program, Using the critical directive allows to only access the variable on one thread at a time so the missed summation before will occur later. This is a much slower program since the threads wait for each other to finish.

In the third program, Using the reduction allows each thread to access its own sum and then get a final reduction at the end. This is a much faster and more effective summation program.
